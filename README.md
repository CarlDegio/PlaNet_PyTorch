# PlaNet_PyTorch
Unofficial re-implementation of "Learning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04551 )

## Instructions
For training, install the requirements (see below) and run
```python
python3 train.py
```

## Requirements
* Python3
* Mujoco (for DeepMind Control Suite)

and see requirements.txt for required python library

## References
